### Projects

- [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) - the most popular cryptocurrency on Blockchain
- [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) - decentralized platform that runs smart contracts with its own cryptocurrency - Ether
- [Chronobank](https://chronobank.io) - wide-ranging blockchain project, aimed at disrupting the HR/recruitment/finance industries in Uber-like way

### Exchanges

[Where to store bitcoins](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet)

For other cryptocurrencies, it's best to use their own wallet (usually from their site, i.e. [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) or [Dash](https://www.dash.org/wallet/))

I found no way to buy bitcoin anonymously, by adequate rate, outside of US and EU, and for USD or Euros. If you know the way, please contact me [here](https://t.me/tmaniac).
